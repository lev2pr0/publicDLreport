# Public Distribution List Report

## Purpose 

Public distribution lists are open to external senders who pose a risk to the organization. External threats such as phishing, whaling, compromised business partners (business email compromise attacks), and other social engineering tactics are concerns. Therefore, a proactive approach to risk management is crucial, even if the groups are limited to specific external senders. 
<br></br>
To address these challenges, this script is designed to automate the generation of a report of members for Distribution Lists open to external senders in Microsoft 365‚Äôs Exchange Online or on-premises Exchange servers.
<br></br>
For further reporting capabilities, refer to the [Mailbox Forward Report](https://github.com/lev2pr0/mailboxforwardreport) feature, which enables the retrieval of reports encompassing all user and shared mailboxes with forwarding SMTP addresses configured.
